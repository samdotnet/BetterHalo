For some reason (money), GCU thinks it's cool to advertise their sponsor to students. I don't like being advertised to, especially in an LMS for a university I pay to go to. This is a simple chrome extension that takes away all of the sponsor logos and links.

## Installation
Currently, this extension isn't on the Chrome Webstore (working on that). It will be there soon, but in the meantime you can install it manually. To do this:
1. Download and unzip files.
2. Go to chrome://extensions and turn on Developer Mode.
3. Click "Load Unpacked" and select the folder the files are in.
